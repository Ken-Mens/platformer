		<h1>Welcome To DragonQuest</h1>
		<h2> "A different take on a classic game"</h2>
		<p> This platformer is inspired by the original Super Mario made in 1985 by Nintendo. Take control of a dragon called Elliot who must traverse the level safely and avoid obstacles. Use the left and right arrow to navivate across as well as the space bar to jump/fly.</p>

		<h1> Feature: Collision Detection </h1>
		<img src="../images/collision.png" alt="Collision" width="300" height="100">
		<p> Tile Collision is tricky concept to make the computer understand. We must first define the tiles so that our dragon character doesn't fall off the map as soon as it is loaded. So the ground, sky, and obstacle tiles must be defined. Then comes the fact that our character is going to be in motion so the environment must never prevent it from moving across. Therefore the x and y axis of our intrepid dragon Elliot must be tracked at all times so that it matches the "ground" tiles and handles smoothly.

		<h1> Feature: Keyboard Input </h1>
		<img src="../images/keyboard.png" alt="Collision" width="300" height="100">
		<p> Keyboard input consist of handling user input and translating it to action on screen. Elliot the dragon moves left, right, and up so the appropiate keys are the left & right arrow keys and the space bar for jumping/flying. The first step is to instruct the computer when a key has been pressed or released. The function listenTo was created to handle this condition, so that whenever a key is being pressed the computer listens to those events as 'keydown' and 'keyup'. The second step was to define the keys being pressed as I want specify which keys that are being listened to. The great part about the newer version of Javascript is that I can easily define the keys with keywords 'Space', 'ArrowRight' and 'ArrowLeft'. From there I mapped the three keys and return input depending on the key status being pressed or released.

		<h1> Feature: Sprite Animation </h1>
		<img src="../images/animation.png" alt="Animation" width="300" height="100">
		<p> Elliot the dragon is a character sprite  derived from a spritesheet with 16*16 pixels. However to bring him to life, I needed several positions to create the sense of motion. There's the inital contact position the recoil and passing steps of animation. I "recovered" those positions from the spritesheet by defining each position in a json file under frames. That is the goal here to mimic movement every frame per second. Elliot was given traits so that his actions consisted of walking and jumping. To animate these actions I've made it so that Elliot accelerates and decelerates based on velocity and time.

<p> This project came together from a simple curiosity in what it took to make a game from scratch. I've heard countless reports of just how stressfull game development can be, of the dreaded crunch time imposed by certain companies, and just how time consuming it could be. Most of all I wanted to pull back the curtains of game development and see what made everything tick be it collision detection or movement mechanics. However I realized very quickly just how complex a game could become depending on how complex the world was. I decided to limit the scope to 2-d and preferably a platformer as it encorporates the basic fundamentals of gaming. Traverse an environment with a character while avoiding/confronting obstacles to reach the end of the level. Super Mario Bros made by Nintendo in 1985 embodies all of those traits so I thought what better game to be inspired by. That was the inception of the DragonQuest platformer. It takes the essential gameplay mechanics from the original Super Mario Bros albeit with a slight twist. </p>

<h1> Dragon Poem </h1>
<p>
a tick of your distant heart
and for me, wheels go spinning

golden spires in evening breeze dip
and you, gripping, reach to the river

what do you see
with your hunting eyes?

what tastes come
in memory?

i see peace all about,
your wings of splendid silver filigree

tail tilted to the setting sun
many Suns within your heart of hearts

do you know i forever run toward you
to all your dragon friends

do you feel me smiling laughing
my joy my welcome?

## Introduction
Dragonquest  is a platformer game that seeks to emulate Super Mario Bros. 

## Description
Developed in 1985 by Nintendo, the original Super Mario Bros still serves as a model template for all platformer games all these years later. Dragonquest is a game that seeks to build from that same mold. Written in Javascript, Dragonquest is an attempt to recreate the classic Nintendo game with a few twists here and there. Test it out for yourself and see if it succeeds in that spirit.

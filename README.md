## Introduction
Dragonquest  is a platformer game that seeks to emulate Super Mario Bros. 

## Description
Developed in 1985 by Nintendo, the original Super Mario Bros still serves as a model template for all platformer games all these years later. Dragonquest is a game that seeks to build from that same mold. Written in Javascript, Dragonquest is an attempt to recreate the classic Nintendo game with a few twists here and there. Test it out for yourself and see if it succeeds in that spirit.

## Installation

To install DragonQuest, clone the repository, and run the command sudo npm run start from said repo. The game runs on local server so you will be notified that locahost: 5000 is running after running the commnand. Certain features such as the camera tracking movement is still not functioning so right drag with mouse will have to used to proceed to end of level.

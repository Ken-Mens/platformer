   ## Introduction
  Dragonquest is a platformer game I created that is heavily inspired by the original Super Mario Bros made by Nintendo. Check it for yourself on my landing page :  [Link to game](https://dragonyquest.herokuapp.com/)

   ## Description
   Developed in 1985 by Nintendo, the original Super Mario Bros still serves as a model template for all platformer games all these years later. Dragonquest is a game that seeks to build from that same mold. Written in Javascript, Dragonquest is an attempt to recreate the classic Nintendo game with a few twists here and th    ere. Test it out for yourself and see if it succeeds in that spirit.
